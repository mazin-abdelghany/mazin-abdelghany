I am a physician-scientist dual-trained in infectious diseases and critical care medicine. I practice medicine and design and run clinical trials as a Director, Clinical Research at Gilead Sciences in Foster City, CA.  

I cultivated a special interest in machine learning while completing my post-doctoral fellowship at the Unviersity of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in Chaz Langelier's lab. Using various machine learning techniques applied to metagenomic sequencing, our team was able to improve the prediction of life-threatening infections in the intensive care unit.  

Though all my previous work was done in R, I am currently learning Python to expand my machine learning toolkit.  

I can be reached by email at mazinabdelghany@duck.com and welcome a discussion with folks looking to collaborate on projects involving machine learning and/or medicine!
