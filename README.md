I am a physician-scientist dual-trained in infectious diseases and critical care medicine. I practice medicine and designed and ran clinical trials as a Director, Clinical Research at Gilead Sciences in Foster City, CA.  I am now a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Cambridge, UK. My doctoral dissertation will discuss the application of Bayesian optimization to improve the efficiency of clinical trials through adaptive designs.

I can be reached by email at mazinabdelghany@duck.com and welcome a discussion with folks looking to collaborate on projects involving biostatistics, machine learning and/or medicine!
